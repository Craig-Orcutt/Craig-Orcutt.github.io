        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>Who is Craig? Great question actually. Since I was a child, I have been searching for what makes me tick. When I found programming, something clicked. I have been hooked ever since, waking up every morning with a desire to learn more. When I'm able to take my eyes away from a computer screen, I enjoy tending to my flowers, carving up a good hunk of wood or just enjoying the great outdoors. </p>
        <h4>Why Programming?</h4>
        <p>I have always enjoyed learning how things work. As the son of an electrical engineer, I was encouraged to take things apart and then(hopefully) put them back together. From my first "Hello World" to building a full stack application, my passion for coding has only increased. Today nothing satisfies me more than getting those "small wins" or experimenting with new(to me) design styles</p>
